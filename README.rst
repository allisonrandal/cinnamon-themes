Cinnamon Themes
===============

I've started experimenting with the Cinnamon desktop, and find it quite
tolerable with some modifications. This repo is mainly a convenience for
synchronizing all my machines on a single consistent look, and backing up my
thematic modifications.

In addition to the customized elements in this repo, I'm currently using
unmodified versions of Mint-Numix-Blue (for Controls and Window Borders) and
Adwaita (for Mouse Pointer).

Licenses

Installation
------------

To install, copy the contents of the themes/ directory to ~/.themes and copy
the contents of the icons/ directory to ~/.icons. If you already have the
Themes settings window open, you'll have to close and re-open it for the new
themes to appear.
